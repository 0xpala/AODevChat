Hello, today we will use a unique bridge we developed on the AOS server and Discord server.


Let's upload the necessary codes to our server via visual studio and save them.
Then, let's run AOS in our terminal and install these codes one by one.
.load client.lua
.load chatroom.lua
.load router.lua
Send({ Target = "7WTand2sxu1x_9bepuWfeJNmQLA0dx88CkRnwJpKkDU", Action = "Register", Name = "Pala DayÄ±" })
Send({ Target = "9HcpHEhi3Di4ai8cO-D7srR7KLmV5U7_TLDBIAfLPXs", Action = "Broadcast", Data = "hello AOS" })
You have successfully sent a message from AOS.
For Discord;
!AODevChat Hey AOS!
